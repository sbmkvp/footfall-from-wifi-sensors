The aims of the main study are,
test the validity of the signal strength algorithm in different 
micro site conditions.
Test that the sequence number algorithm works in real world
for different locations and different times.
Test if the calibration works over intervals
Finally conclude if we can estimate footfall confidently
with just probe requests.
